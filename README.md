<h1><center>Welcome to Ananda College Colombo</center></h1>

A need of the era, in the British colonial period, an English education for the children of majority Buddhists of the country became a reality, when on 1st November, 1886, a daily English school was opened at No: 64, in Maliban Street, Pettah, pioneered by Ven. Hikkaduwe Sri Sumangala Thero and inspired by Col. Henry Steele Olcott, the founder of Buddhist Theosophical Society ( popularly known as BTS ). Starting with a mere student population of 37, it was soon re-located at Paranavadiya in Maradana, where it blossomed into present day pristine glory, accommodating over 6000 students. Re-named “ Ananda College “, after Buddha’s chief disciple Arahat Ananda, it earned reputation as island’s Premier Buddhist Educational Institution for boys.
